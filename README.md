### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal GitHub account, a vault of all my surviving projects. 

Hereâ€™s a little about myself:
- I'm currently a masterâ€™s student in Computer Science with a strong interest in technology, system design, and computer networking.
- Iâ€™m learning ASP.NET to deepen my knowledge in back-end development.
